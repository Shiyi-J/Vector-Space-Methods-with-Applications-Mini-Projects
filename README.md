# Vector-Space-Methods-with-Applications-Mini-Projects

This repository contains three mini-projects.

1. The Markov chain project explores concepts such as absorbing states, hitting times, recurrent states and stationary probabilities.
2. The LSQ project learns the linear least-square classifier.
3. The AltProj project investigates how to use alternating projection to solve a system of linear equations, bound the value of a convex optimization and train a linear classifier.
